# Keep in mind....Vagrant will always create an initial interface as a NAT interface..Any definitions below are for adding additional interfaces.
# for network_name define a var other than remaining blank to define an internal only network. Otherwise leave blank for a host-only network.
# for DHCP leave ip and network_name vars blank
# for Static define ip var
# type should generally be private_network..Other option(s) are: public_network
